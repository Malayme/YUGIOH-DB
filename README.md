In this repo you will find multiples things, but if you are here you will be more interested by all .csv files.  
The main csv file "files_combines.csv" contain all the list of cards in french in TCG.  
In the directory "dusty" you will find all the list of card by extensions not formated in .csv.  
In the directory "clean" you will have the same as "dusty" but formated by a ',' separator and not '$' in the "dusty" folder.
The rest is python script made with AI to change all "$" signs in "," and to combine all clean .csv file in one.

You can use this repo as you wish until i don't receive a mail from Konami or anything else.  
Don't hesitate to contact me if you need help.
